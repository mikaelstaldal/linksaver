# Link Saver

A simple and efficient web application for saving and managing your favorite links. 
Link Saver automatically extracts page title, description and optionally screenshots from URLs and 
provides a web interface for organizing your bookmarks.

You can also save short notes which are not connected to any particular URL along with your bookmarks.

## Clients

In addition to the built-in web interface, there is also 

* A [native Android app](https://github.com/mikaelstaldal/linksaver-android)
* A [desktop application]https://github.com/mikaelstaldal/linksaver-desktop)

## Features

- **Save Links**: Add URLs with automatic title and description extraction and screenshots from web pages
- **Save Nodes**: Write short notes and save them among your bookmarks.
- **SQLite Storage**: Lightweight, file-based database with no external dependencies
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker containers
- **HTTP basic auth**: Protect the application with username and password

## Run with Docker (with screenshot support)

1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t linksaver .
   ```
2. Run the container without authentication, listing on localhost only:
   ```bash
   docker run --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd)/data,dst=/data" --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 linksaver
   ```
3. Run the container with HTTP basic authentication, listing externally:
   ```bash
   htpasswd -cBC 12 pwfile my_username
   docker run --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd)/pwfile,dst=/pwfile" --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd)/data,dst=/data" --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges -p 8080:8080 linksaver -basic-auth-file /pwfile
   ```
Note: This is only secure if you also use https.   

The application will store data in the directory mounted at `/data`, using `data/linksaver.sqlite` as the database file 
and store screenshots in `data/screenshots`. 


## Run without Docker (without screenshot support)

1. Build the standalone executable
   ```bash
   go build -tags netgo -v ./cmd/linksaver/
   ```
2. Run it without authentication, listing on localhost only:
   ```bash
   ./linksaver -port 8080 -addr 127.0.0.1 -data data
   ```  
3. Run it with HTTP basic authentication, listing externally:
   ```bash
   htpasswd -cBC 12 pwfile my_username
   ./linksaver -port 8080 -data data -basic-auth-file pwfile
   ```  
Note: This is only secure if you also use https.   

The application will store data in the `./data` directory, using `./data/linksaver.sqlite` as the database file.

You can use the `apparmor-profile` file as a template for an Apparmor profile, you need to substitute 
`${PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE}` and `${PATH_TO_DATA}` with absolute paths. 
This has only been tested on Ubuntu and Debian Linux.

## Web Interface

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
- `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port)

From the web interface, you can:
1. **Add a new link**: Enter a URL in the input field and click "Add Link"
2. **Add a new note**: Enter title and text in the input fields and click "Add Note"
3. **View all links**: All saved links/notes are displayed on the main page
4. **Delete a link**: Click the delete button next to any link/note to remove it
